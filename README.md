## Introduction

Today you'll worth through 7 JavaScript Tasks to practice today's objectives and get familiar and comfortable with the foundations of JavaScript.

Exercises are outlined in the `index.js` file, please read the instructions carefully for each task and complete it. Note that you may have to use your googling skills to research and look things up if you do not have all the information you need to complete the task.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

Using VSCode, Codegrade and Command Line:

1. ✅ Fork the repo
2. ✅ Go into canvas and connect your reop to codegrade
3. ✅ Clone your forked version of the repo
4. ✅ DO NOT CREATE A BRANCH. You will be pushing your changes to the main/master today
5. ✅ cd into your repo
6. ✅ Open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
7. ✅ Next type `npm run test` in your terminal
8. ✅ Complete your work making regular commits to main/ master your codegrade score will update each time you make a push.

### Task 2: MVP

✅ Find the `index.js` file and complete the tasks as written.

### Testing & Debugging

✅ Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon

✅ Inside of your second terminal type `npm start`

✅ You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

✅ After you have completed the requirements, try any of the following challenges. As always, note that these may require additional research beyond what you learned in this module.

-   [x] See tasks labelled stretch. Please ensure you've completed MVP before you attempt the stretch goals. Note that you may need to look forward to tomorrow's training kit in order to complete the task.

## Submission format

✅ Please submit your project via codegrade by following [these instructions](https://lambdaschool.notion.site/lambdaschool/Lambda-School-Git-Flow-Step-by-step-269f68ae3bf64eb689a8328715a179f9) See part 2, submitting an assignment with codegrade
